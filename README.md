# 12‑Week ML for Finance Self‑Study Roadmap

**Transforming theory into publishable research & real‑world finance models**  
I’m on a 12‑week sprint—60–80 hrs/week—building theory, replication studies, and an original ML‑for‑finance project. I’ll post daily progress updates, insights, failures, and wins on LinkedIn and X to grow a community, get feedback from advisors, and catch the eye of quant firms.

## 🚀 Why Follow Along?
- **Real‑time learning**: See how I tackle proofs, implement papers, debug models, and iterate.  
- **Networking & feedback**: Drop comments or DMs on LinkedIn/X to guide me or suggest papers.  
- **Career signal**: Quant firms, research labs, and PhD advisors—watch my journey and reach out if you see fit.
